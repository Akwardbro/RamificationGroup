# Generality of Definitons

### ltIdeal and leIdeal

Same as Valuation.integers. However, special notations are only defined for Valued instances.

### Ramification Index

Only for maps between Discretely Valued Field.

### Lower Numbering

Mathematically (after some discussion with professor Liang Xiao), lower numbering is only meaningful for finite extention of local fields. (by meaningful I mean having a well behaved Herbrand function) And Serre and wikipedia uses G_i for s(x) >= i + 1, this +1 only works for integers. For present, I choose not to generlize it to keep my notation same with Serre's book. It will only be defined for `Valued R Zm0` for now, and properties will be proved only for finite ext of local fields.

The index will be in WithTop Z (or a new def definitionlly equal to WithTop Z to support instance), not Zm0. Coe function between them will be written. **Warning: 1 in Z will be mapped to 1 in Zm0.** That's quite disturbing since this is not the "log map" connecting add and mul version.

### Upper Numbering

Saito's work would be a much much later work.

It will be indexed in Q. If Hasse-Arf is proved, there will be a indexed in Z version for Abelian extensions.

The point is that upper numbering can be defined for finite or infinite Galois extensions. Finite version as auxillary first, then general definitions.
