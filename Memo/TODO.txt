1. add lift lemmas such as lift refl = refl lift symm = symm, make them @[simp]
2. low priority, add coe lemmas in ValHom,...
3. we need a bundled version ValAlgEquiv.restrictScalarsₘ, AlgEquiv.restrictScalarsₘ is not in mathlib?

3.31 
1. add instances of intermediate field being ValAlg correctly
2. change lemmas from requiring intermediate field to IsScalarTower
3. (high!) make restrictNormal works good, put in the correct file  also  restrictScalarsₘ restrictScalars

4.4
1. (high!) Try to change all theorems using ValHom and ValAlgEquiv into simple RingHom ALgHom. Then G_-1 will be a subgroup of GalGroup. Add IsValExtension K' L (do I need injectivity?) to state theorem for L/K'/K

4.7  Finished!!
IsValExt gives alg structure for integer and valsubring
lower
upper 

4.8
add exhausive and seperated for upper

4.10
renaming (for presentation)
