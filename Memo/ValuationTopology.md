# Valuation Topology

The valuation topology is NOT defined for arbitary `v : Valuation R G`, it is defined for `[Valued R G]` and is itself an instance.

### Todo

Check in Mathlib that

1. whether preorder of divisibility of Valued is defined, and
2. whether `OrderTopology` instance is defined for `Valued`.
