# Discretely Valued Field and Complete Discretely Valued Field

Todo: 

1. Translate the definition of DVF/DVR (I shall use `DiscretelyValuedRing` to distinguish it with `DiscreteValuationRing` already in mathlib whose definition doesn't need valuation at all) from Maria and Philip's repo.
2. Check whether a class of CDVF/CDVR or LocalField exists. (CDVF/CDVR not exist as a class, it is just DVF + C.)
